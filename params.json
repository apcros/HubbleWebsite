It will currently display useful stats like CPU, RAM and Disk usage. \r\nIt's been made with simplicity and easy setup in mind. \r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nYou can find the documentation for Hubble Server's API on [apiary](https://jsapi.apiary.io/previews/hubbleweb/reference) \r\n\r\n### Project evolution\r\nHubble is a very young project. Because of that it's in constant evolution and loads of things are still missing.\r\nEverything, especially API related are likely to change while Hubble is in Alpha. \r\nBeta will freeze some of the features and limit some of the evolution. \r\nIn the meantime you can track the progress here : \r\n[https://tree.taiga.io/project/apcros-hubble/kanban](https://tree.taiga.io/project/apcros-hubble/kanban)\r\n\r\n### Goodies\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@Apcros\r\n",
